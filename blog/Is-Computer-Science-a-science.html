			Any study is a science if it is based on scientific thinking methodology. This methodology follows number of steps: set assumptions, collect data, do experiments then experiments lead to observations and later to conclusions. 
		</p>
		<p> 
		These steps are cycled again to confirm results and some steps may go before the other. Yet, many scientific disciplines do not follow the exact scheme. Modern approaches involves –not direct- experimentation of natural phenomena, rather simulation (using complex computer programs) of these phenomena.
		</p>
		<p>
		Attaching to the idea that a study to be a science must follow the scheme of scientific thinking including experimentation or simulation, Mathematics & theoretical sciences are not science at all. Modern science filled the gap between theory and experimentation. To do an experiment you need to follow a theoretical (mathematical) model. A strong example is the Large Hardon Collider (LHC) experiment at CERN. First, a theory was proposed about the existence of Higgs Boson particle [1] the theory was then tested by the experiment. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Since 1950s many advances in technology (the application of a scientific theory or a mathematical model) appeared, one of them is the transistor [2].  The transistor, integrated circuits and many other electronics advances reshaped our daily life. The transistor lead to the invention of digital electronic computers (computers existed before where either elector mechanical based or vacuum tubes based). 
		</p>
		<p>
		Before the invention of transistor, Alan Turing in 1936 described a hypothetical machine called Turing Machine. Turing machines are theoretical machines which have infinite memory that are capable of performing any mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm (finite steps of logical or arithmetic operations). Turing machine design suggests that any computer should have a processing unit, a memory and input/output line between them (that reads or writes form the memory tape). 
		</p>
		<p>
		To compute is to calculate, while calculation is a term for arithmetic operations, computations involves more than arithmetic: logical operations, data manipulation and memory operations.  A computer (theoretically or real) is capable of following an exact procedure to go from an input to an output after a series of steps, a computer is said to be executing the program. Through history, computer science was an emergent field of mathematics about computability. Early computer scientist were mathematicians like Turing.
		</p>
		<p>
		Now, is Mathematics a science? Many refuse to say that Mathematics is a science. Physicists, chemists and biologist use Mathematics to describe and formulate well their conclusions and hypotheses.  They use Mathematics as a language to describe complex systems and phenomena.
		</p>
		<p>
		If Mathematics is a language, then Computer Science is a beautiful novel written in it. Computer Science is about computing everything (even universe laws as in digital physics). Nowadays, Computer Science practices involves designing algorithms that solve certain problems. Given a problem, you formulate the problem (give it a formal definition). Then you purpose a computable solution (can be executed on a Turing machine or a machine equivalent to Turing machine). You test this solution by proving that it gives the correct corresponding output every time we execute this solution. We can prove this by a mathematical proof or by executing the solution (here it is an executable program) on a computer. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Here, we designed or formulated an algorithm. We test in an experiment, recorded the output and then we run the test several times to ensure that this is the correct solution. This cycle is a scientific thinking methodology to solve a problem. One major difference between the cycles of problem solving and scientific thinking that, while solving a problem it is required not to give a solution but an elegant solution, that is a faster efficient algorithm that saves computer resources.   
		</p>
		<p>
		After all, Computer Science is the science of how to think for solutions, designing algorithms and testing it. Even if Computer Science is not a theoretical or practical science, just as Mathematics it is a necessary tool for every field of science.
